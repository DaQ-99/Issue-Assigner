1,[Infra] Network service needed,"As we use `Clickhouse` to finish all queries and the database is inside the campus. a solution about how to visit internal service from Internet is essential.

There are two approaches for this issue:
- Expose a public service to Internet, which means need to fill an application.
- If the internal machine has a stable network to visit Internet, we can use proxy like [smee.io](smee.io) to forward requests to it.

The first one is preferred because according to current situation the visit to Internet is not stable and if the network broke, it is hard to reset the service without restart the app."
2,[Feature] Basic framework needed,We need a basic framework and file structure of this report project.
3,[Infra] Slack channel setup with synchronization,"Like `Wuhan2020` project, I think we can also use Slack as the IM tool for collaberation, and an independent workspace is mroe suitable.

Any suggestions ? "
7,[Test] A test issue for anything.,This is a test issue.
12,[Feature] Auto update report component needed,We need an auto update report component for hypertrons to make sure we can automatically update the report by data and template regularly.
13,[Feature] Sql run command need to be supported,"We need to support `/sql-run` command, which will trigger a pull request SQL request from Hypertrons and return the result by comment."
20,[Discussion] We need to determine the license we use,"At start, I commit Apache 2.0 License for the project, I think it is OK for the code part which is the hypertrons workflow components and post processor for SQL components.

But we should also determine what License we use for the docs part which is the report, I think we should protect the report quite carefully, maybe one of CC-BY 4.0 can be considered.

WDYT?"
22,[Docs] Contributing guide doc needed.,"We need a comprehensive contributing guide for developers both in English and in Chinese.

The contributing guide can be like a traditional one but with the custom workflow of this project."
23,[Docs] Data description doc needed,"The data description document need to be added, which may include data source, database, data structure, basic SQL guide and other things about the data to help developers understand how to use data."
24,[Docs] Architect & workflow doc needed,"We need a document to describe the architect of the infrastructure and workflow of the project, like hypertrons, database and etc.

We can use plantuml files to render the diagram, hypertrons may provide render ability of this kind of files."
25,[Docs] We need to add more details to the report template,"The report template is quite simple now, we can add more details into it, refer to [GitHub Analysis Report 2019]() and may involve several SQL components development."
34,[Feature] UML renderer for PR should be in work flow,"We have a lot of diagrams written in UML format and we can render them with Hypertrons too. But if the UML file is edited from a PR, we can not easily check whether it is as expected or not.

For UML files in PR, maybe we can provide a component to render them in PR and comment back to check."
39,[Docs] Add workflow for other types of commiting(besides sql),"We need a document to describe the workflow for commiting other files(excluding sql). Such as  if the PR contains `docs` in the title, the bot will add `area/document` label."
42,[Proposal] New committer proposal,"As [`CONTRIBUTORS`]() file shows, @sunshinemingo is quite active for past two weeks in project discussion, I propose @sunshinemingo to be our new committer to approve PR."

- A folder contains all case study files include a report template and a config file for the case study.
- A folder contains all SQL components for all case study report under SQL folder.

And the component should run every day to update all case study reports and create PR to submit all the reports. May refer to  ."
205,[Feature] Global developer analysis should be added.,"Now we already have a global rank list for top 10 repos, but we still need a similar component to generate global developers rank list too. We may also use the traditional activity calculation method and add the result into the main report."

In GitHub report 2019 we use a text file to indicate all main Chinese projects on GitHub to generate the report, we may use the same way to collect all Chinese projects.

209,[Refactor] Add more details for top repos.,"Currently we only have activity score for top 10 repos, we may also add total issue count, pr count, comment count and review count and active developers' count for every repo too."
216,[Refactor] Minor changes for top repos and developers,"I think we can make some minor changes for top repos and developers:

- The repo name is not determinate for every query as `anyLast` is indeterminate according to [clickhouse docs](), we may change to [`anyHeavy`]() which will return most frequent name for each repo and user.
- repo_id can be removed from the result.
- We can add more details into the repos' result, like language information.
- We can also add more details into the repos and developers' result, like LOC additions, deletions and commits count from pull request."

552,[Discussion] Idea list for Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan,"Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan is coming!

Introduction
Open Source Promotion Plan encourages everyone to pay close attention to open source software and open source community, aiming to cultivate and explore more outstanding developers. Summer 2021 will be held in this summer. We will collaborate closely with the open source community to provide one-to-one mentor guidance and invite some specialists to conduct free online lectures. In order to promote the development of open source software and facilitate the construction of excellent open source software community, we encourage researchers, open source enthusiasts, professors as well as students to participate in the development and maintenance of open source software. Furthermore, Summer 2021 is supposed to increase the activity of open source projects, and promote the development of open source ecology.

Home：
Help：

### OpenDigger community
OpenDigger has been accepted as the community of Summer 2021.
![image]()

### Ideas list for OpenDigger
OpenDiggger will provide some ideas for Summer 2021. If you have any ideas, please comment on this issue. We really appreciate it.

**Please pay attention to that we need to post our ideas before `20 May`.**
"
556,[Feature] We need more data for sample data container.,"We need more data for sample data container. Right now, the container contains all history event logs with one second in an hour, but it is not sufficient for case study.

Like in VSCode study, we need to figure out the issue response and resolve period of a certain repo but the data is not enough to generate any result so we can not test the result.

We may add some top repos or orgs full data into the sample data so we can test case study."
557,[Feature]Generate weekly reports for specified projects or organizations,"## Requirements:
After user specifying some projects, the program can generate a weekly data report regularly to show the activity of these projects during the week and rank them.

## Detail
The dimensions and format displayed in the weekly report can be based on the ""GitHub most active 20 repositories"" report, with a general activity indicator, and some detailed data such as pr and commit.
![image]()

## Why do I have such a demand?
I am currently responsible for the open source governance of the sofastack community. Our community has multiple projects. I hope to visually display the weekly activity of each project through digital operations, and encourage everyone to invest more in open source by publishing a weekly report.
I believe that other communities or foundations will have similar needs.

## Technical solutions
1. Data: The historical log of the specified projects can be obtained using the github API
2. No need to write UI,as long as the statistical results can be written into a file or database, users can generate reports with excel or use grafana to generate dashboards.

I can also participate in the development of this feature



Chinese:
## 需求
由用户指定一些项目，程序每周生成一份数据周报，用于展现这些项目的活跃度，并进行排名。

## 细节
周报展示的维度、形式就按照""GitHub most active 20 repositories""报表即可，有一个概括性的活跃度指标、一目了然的展现出活跃情况，以及一些详细的数据例如pr、commit。
![image]()

## 为什么我有这样的需求？
我目前负责sofastack社区的开源治理，我们社区有多个项目，我希望通过数字化运营的方式直观的展示每个项目每周的活跃度，通过发数据周报的方式激励大家更多的投入开源。
相信其他社区或者基金会也会有类似需求。

## 方案
1. 数据：可以基于github API获取指定仓库的历史日志
2. 前端可以不用做，只要能把统计出来的结果写入文件或者数据库即可，用户可以自行用excel生成报表或者用grafana生成dashboard

我也可以参与开发该功能

- The duration of a review cycle within a single change request.
- This metric provides maintainers with insight on:  Code review process decay, as there are more iterations and review cycle durations increase. **Process bottlenecks resulting in long code review iterations**.

- Average or Median Duration
#### optionally filtered or grouped by: 
- Number of people involved in review 
- Number of comments in review 
- Edits made to a change request

Review Cycle Duration is measured as the time length of one review cycle within a single change request. 
The duration can be calculated between: 
- The moment when each review cycle begins, defined as the point in time when a change request is submitted or updated. 
- The moment when each review cycle ends, either because **the change request was updated and needs a new review** or **because it was accepted or rejected**.

- A long time to respond to an activity can be a sign that a community is not responsive. A short time to respond to an activity can help to engage more members into further discussions and within the community

**Filters**
- Role of responder, e.g., only count maintainer responses
- Automated responses, e.g., only count replies from real people by filtering bots and other automated replies
- Type of Activity, e.g., issues (see metric **Issue Response Time**), change requests


**Instances of Implementation** 
`Time to first response of an activity = time first response was posted to the activity - time the activity was created

578,[Metrics] Code Changes,"**Description**
- For ""change"" we consider what developers consider an atomic change to their code.
- In other words, a change is some change to the source code which usually is accepted and merged as a whole, and if needed, reverted as a whole too.
- In the case of git, each ""change"" corresponds to **a ""commit"" that touches files considered as source code.**

**Implementation**
- Commits by week
- Commits by actors `(committers or normal contributors)`
- Commits by tag `(a fix for a bug or an improvement of a feature)`

**Resource**

"
579,[Metrics] Code Changes Lines,"**Description**
- The sum of the number of lines touched (lines added plus lines removed) in all changes to the source code during a certain period
- Lines of code will be any line of a source code file, including comments and blank lines.

**Objective**
Although code changes can be a proxy to the coding activity of a project, not all changes are the same. Considering the aggregated number of lines touched in all changes gives a complementary idea of how large the changes are, and in general, how large is **the volume of coding activity**.

591,[Metrics] Inactive Contributors,"**Description**
- How many Contributors have stopped contributing over a specific period of time.
- The period of time required for a contributor to be counted as inactive can be decided by a variable and this metric will display the number of contributors that have been labeled as inactive over a given time frame.

**Filters**
- Minimum contributions required to be considered active
- Period of time to determine inactivity
- Start date/End date

**Implementation**
The metric will take in two variables - **a time period** and a **interval.**
- time period: the period over which the number of inactive members will be displayed
- interval: determine how long it takes for a contributor to be labeled as inactive

The metric will work by:
1. getting a list of all contributors
2. checking the last contribution date
3. if the last contribution date is before the cutoff then add them to the inactivity count of the period they last contributed in.
4. create list of inactive contributors

602,[Feature Request]add a weekly case study for SOFAStack&MOSN community,"## Requirements
After submiting the issue #557 ,I talked with @frank-zsy and we managed to find out an easier way to generate weekly reports for the specific repositorys.
Here is the approach :
1. Add a case study about the repos,with a 'where 'statement in the sql to filter out the event logs only in last 7 days.
2. Run the case study every week to generate a weekly report,using the data in ClickHouse. (I would appreciate it if it can be generated on Saturday before 4 p.m.)

So I come here to submit a feature request to add a weekly case study for SOFAStack&MOSN community.

## Details
The dimensions and format displayed in the weekly report can be same with the ""GitHub most active 20 repositories"" report. The only difference is that I just want the statistics based on the event logs in **last week** and **in specific repositorys**.
![image]()

It is better to add a new column 'new contributors'.But it is ok if the program don't do that automatically,since I can do it myself.

611,[feature] [Discussion] Some suggestions on system design,"
There are currently some problems with this project:

Each customized requirement needs to be completed manually every time. If A customizes several index reports for Project A, and B customizes the same index report for B, it seems that it needs to be written twice at present. For the general index of the report, such as the monthly data growth, it cannot be completed by the customer. It needs to submit the requirements to the project team and the project team manually deploys it online.

Regarding the above questions, I put forward some suggestions for improvement of the system:

1. Modify some specific data in SQL as parameters, and pass the parameters to SQL through Shell to complete the data query. You can also check the parameters in the shell script.

2. Increase the account system, members can select the indicators they need according to the list, and let the background generate new reports according to the set time (of course these may incur additional expenses, and there are many rules that need to be discussed).

---
目前这个项目存在一些问题：

每个定制的需求需要每次手动的完成。如果A定制了A项目的几个指数报表，B定制了B同样的指数报表,目前似乎需要写两遍。对于报表的通用型指数——比如每月数据增长量，不能由客户自己完成，需要向项目组提交需求，项目组手动部署上线。

对于以上的问题，提出对系统的一些改进意见：

1.  将 SQL 中的一些具体的数据修改为参数，通过 Shell 将参数传递给 SQL, 完成数据的查询。在 shell 脚本中还可以对完成对参数的检查。

2.  增加账号系统，会员可以根据列表选择自己需要的指标，并让后台按设定的时间产生新的报告(当然这些可能会产生额外的开支，也有许多规则需要讨论)。

613,[Discussion] About the granularity of the template,"At the 15th weekly meeting, contributors proposed to divide the components into templates and diagrams.
I suggest making some adjustments to this scheme. The template should be divided into two types: **report** and **sub-module**.
**Sub-module**: One is text and graphs about a certain statistical data (it is very important to be able to configure the position relationship between graphs and texts), and the other is pure explanatory text (this is mainly an introduction to the project).
**Report**: A report rendered by sub-modules, queried data, and copywriting based on the queried data (for example, OpenDigger Global Study Report).

---

在第 15 次周会上，贡献者提出将组件分为**模板**和**图表**两种。
我建议对这种方案做一些调整，模板应该分为**报告**和**子模块**两种。
**子模块**：一种是关于某个统计数据的文字和图表（能够配置图表和文字的位置关系是非常重要的），另一种是单纯的说明文字（这种主要是对项目的介绍）。
**报告**：由子模块、查询出来的数据和根据查询出的数据编写的文案渲染出来的报告（比如：OpenDigger Global Study Report）。

622,[Bug] OSSChat maybe have a problem,OSSChat cannot synchronize GitHub information to WeChat.
623,[discussion] 关于 “活跃度” 相关讨论,"在[开源数字洞察报告会议-第16次]()中关于“活跃度“称呼的问题讨论，这里想延续下讨论：
先说结论——我支持”活跃度“这一称呼。
”度“——可以泛指按一定计量标准划分的单位，如”温度“、”湿度“......
而一个项目的每一个操作如 issue，pr 都可以称为一次”活跃“。
""活跃度""这一称呼问题不大。"
624,[discussion] Star Should NOT be Counted as Activeness,"The active of ""star"" is essentially a marker that expresses the prospective user's interest in the project, not the activity of the project itself.

If it is to be counted as activity, the weight should be adjusted to a very low level.

---

”star“这种行为本质上是一种标记，表达的是准用户对项目的观望，不能算项目本身的活动。

如果实在要算作活动，应该把权重调整到非常低。
"
625,[discussion] About calculating the loss of contributors,"In [this meeting](), Frank proposed that if a contributor has not been active for more than half a year, he is considered to be lost from the community. In my opinion, this issue cannot be prescribed artificially and a conclusion should be drawn through data analysis.

We should count the maximum value of the time interval between a contributor's two active activities in a project. Analyze the relationship between this data and some influencing factors such as the project life cycle.

---

在[这次会议]()中，Frank 提出如果一个贡献者超过半年没有活跃，就认为他从社区流失了。我认为，这个问题不能人为规定，应该通过数据分析得出结论。

我们应该统计一个贡献者在一个项目两次活跃时间间隔的最大值。分析这个数据与一些影响因素如项目生命周期的关系。

---

**Talk is cheap. Show me your data.** "

Right now, we will have several label category like: region, company, community, foundation/incubator, tech category.

'|-label_data
'|--company
'|----alibaba
'|----microsoft
'|----tencent
'|----baidu
'|--region
'|----china
'|--community
'|----dubbo

781,《2022 中国开源发展蓝皮书》数据支撑,"### Discussed in 

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **will-ww** March 17, 2022</sup>
去年 OpenDigger 的部分内容支持了《2021 中国开源发展蓝皮书》：

今年我们继续，和 Frank 讨论后，今年可以直接提供一个 Jupyter Notebook 的文件，然后让编委方进行加工，这样我们给不同方面输出的成果能够标准化，便于我们开发。

还请 Frank 将框架中的几个内容跑出来（目前还无法做到的删掉即可），我增加点文字，即可交付过去了。（直接参考了我们”GitHub 2021 数字洞察报告“的结构内容 ）

**1.  总体情况**

- 全球日志事件、活跃仓库数量、活跃开发者数量，近5年的总体数量与每年的增长率。
- 中国日志事件、活跃仓库数量、活跃开发者数量，近5年的总体数量与每年的增长率。

即这部分，展示全球以及中国的整体趋势状况即可，如果能有些时空分布图则更好，特别是全球开发者的地理位置分布。

**2. 中美企业对比情况**

- 2021年美国企业活跃度 Top10 榜单，包括：排名、企业名、总活跃度、日均活跃度、项目总数、参与贡献者总数，人均活跃度
- 2021年中国企业活跃度 Top10 榜单，包括：排名、企业名、总活跃度、日均活跃度、项目总数、参与贡献者总数，人均活跃度
- 2021年美国企业影响力 Top10 榜单，包括：排名、企业名、影响力、项目总数、参与贡献者总数，人均影响力
- 2021年中国企业影响力 Top10 榜单，包括：排名、企业名、影响力、项目总数、参与贡献者总数，人均影响力
- 近十年中国厂商开源活跃度 TOP 10。（类似《中国十年开源洞察报告》）
- 近十年中国厂商开源影响力 TOP 10。
- 某种方式的对比，最好能体现中国某一个方面的上升或接近（项目数量、参与人数、总体/人均等）

**3. 中国项目情况**

- GitHub 2021 年全球项目活跃度 Top 20
- GitHub 2021 年中国项目活跃度 Top 20
- GitHub 2021 年全球项目影响力 Top 20
- GitHub 2021 年中国项目影响力 Top 20
- 近5年，中国 Top10 项目活跃度变化趋势图
- 近5年，中国 Top10 项目影响力变化趋势图
- 某种方式的对比，最好能体现中国某一个方面的上升或接近（项目活跃度/影响力、参与人数、总体/人均等）

以上内容是我想到的适合放到《2022 中国开源发展蓝皮书》，可以任意修改和删减~ @frank-zsy

793,About remove GitHub App data from OpenRank,"We removed GitHub App data (which created by [bot] like account) from the OpenRank calculation with the following reason:

- The OpenRank is a PageRank like algorithm which not only use statistic data but also look into the relationship between users and repos. But GitHub App like dependabot can be installed on any repo which will break the deeper information the collaboration relationships offer. So we choose to remove bot from the OpenRank calculation but we will still include them in activity calculation."
794,[Proposal] Add COSS proejct list,"In the last several years, there are more and more commerial open source projects (COSS) rised in China. Compare to many opensource projects hosted by internet companies, COSS is typical drived by independent software companies.

In America, there is a Venture Captial (OSS Captial， ） focused to invest COSS projects and they mantain one COSS project list （#gid=0）

I think open-digger project can do similar thing to maintain COSS project list in China.  Not Only does it help open-digger to analyze more open-source project in China, but also it can help team to do more deep investigation on COSS projects in China."

841,[Refactor] Change database structure for underlying lib,"As discussed in  , we change the underlying database structure of clickhouse.

The modification contains:

- Put all data into one table, the data now all in `github_log.events`.
- Change `id` column to `UInt64` type.
- Change all enum columns into `Enum` type rather than ordinary string type.
- Change all `repo_name` and `actor_login` into `LowCardinality` type rather than ordinary string type.
- Change underlying storage engine to `ReplacingMergeTree` rather than `MergeTree`.

These changes will decrease memory use and calculation time of all queries, but we also need to change the underlying implementation of OpenDigger to fit the new database.

The changes should contain:

- [ ] The implementation of OpenDigger metric calculation.
- [ ] The doc of database structure.
- [ ] The sample docker images for local development."

861,[Refactor] SQL optimize for activity,"Right now, `index.activity` uses ClickHouse and script to implement a quite complex and not quite efficient version to calculate activity for repos and developers. But with some powerful functions provided by ClickHouse engine, we can do this more elegant and efficient.

We could use `groupArrayInsertAt` and `limit by (key)` to get the general SQL better. Be aware that the server version is 20.8.7.15 which does support dynamic array length so we need to calculate the array length first in the script."

Now that I have a list of CII repositories, I want to get all the repositories and developers within 6 hops of the GitHub-wide collaboration network from those repositories and use that data to build my heterogeneous network of developer collaboration.

This is not a simple task, as it involves a lot of data and can be very time-consuming. So I wanted to ask what are the best practices for getting this done?  Notebook？ @frank-zsy @wengzhenjie @bifenglin

914,The algorithm to count the stars of a repository is incorrect.,"### Question Description

In [Clickhouse Demo](), we have the below algorithm (we will call it 'Original Algorithm' for short) to count the stars of a repository:



But I found that if we use another algorithm (we will call it '**New Algorithm**' for short) as below we can get a different result which does not contain the removed or duplicated stars:



This result may not be correct, but I think it is more close to the correct answer.

### Evaluation

You mentioned in the article that 
> There is no events when someone removes the star. This means that star removal is invisible, but it should be rare in any case, so we can calculate the approximate number of stars from these events.

But I think the difference can be very large.


If we use the two algorithms to calculate the stars before 7/9/2022, we can get these two results:
1. Original Algorithm:
    
2. **New Algorithm**:
    
We can see that there are a lot of changes in order.


I use a query to figure out how different between the two algorithm:


### Summary
Anyway, I think we should use the New Algorithm to calculate the stars.

---

### Appendix

The difference rate can be calculated by the query below:

So we come into another problem: why is the difference rate (difference between original algorithm between new algorithm / original algorithm counts) much larger than 1."
917,[Doc] The command line to initialize a clickhouse database may cause a bug.,"### Description

According to the following README:

#L13

When we want to initialize a clickhouse database of open-digger, the docker command line is `docker run -d --name container_name -m 6G -p 8123:8123 -p 9000:9000 --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 --volume=./folder_path/:/data/ open-digger-clickhouse-base:v1`.

Pay attention to the VOLUME part `--volume=./folder_path/:/data/`. This command line may lead to a bug.

For example, if I want to bind-mount the `./label_2015` to container's `/data`, we will get an error:



And if we remove the `.` and  `/` in `./label_2015`, we will get another error:



We can see that there is something wrong with the `/data` in the container and it must be caused by the argument `label_2015`.

### Reason

The reason of this bug is the rule of `host-src` in `--volume=[host-src:]container-dest[:<options>]`.

As referred in [Docker's Doc](#volume-shared-filesystems), the `host-src` in `--volume=[host-src:]container-dest[:<options>]` must be an absolute path or a name value.
- If you supply an absolute path for the `host-src`, Docker bind-mounts to the path you specify. 
- If you supply a name, Docker creates a named volume by that name.

**A name value must start with an alphanumeric character, followed by `a-z0-9`, `_` (underscore), `.` (period) or `-` (hyphen). An absolute path starts with a `/` (forward slash).**

**So, the `./folder_path` in our README may mislead the reader to use a relative path in the command line.**(Guess who have been misled already.) 

### Suggestion

I think may be we should modify this part in README and place a notice right after it?"
919, process.env. GITHUB_ EVENT_ Path,"Run pulll_ labe_ file_ test. ts, GitHub_ EVENT_ Path cannot get value，and I don't know how to get it.

1006,Calculation method of project activity,"Regarding the open source community activity calculation method, should we consider the weight of the metric in the calculation formula? Can we change the length of time needed to complete the metric into the weight, and then add it to the activity calculation formula? If we define open source community activity as the total amount of time investment that an open source community attracts from around the world, divided by unit time. Let's say it takes a user 1 second to click on a star. fork a warehouse, about 2 to 3 seconds. It takes about 5 minutes to submit an issue. The time to resolve an issue can take hours, along with other metrics such as PR. From this point of view, the weight of star is at the level of seconds, while the weight of issue, PR should be at the level of minutes or even hours. Is this a reasonable calculation that we can consider?"

1033,[Feature] New data export method,"As mentioned in #1030 , I would like to make a new data export method to export GitHub repo and user data to OSS, so developers can use the data to implement their own applications.

The plan is:
- Consider the huge amount of repos and users on GitHub, we will only export part of the repos and users which are relatively active. The process is:
  - We will export all the data for the repos which have at least 3 developers participated in any month, the amount will be about 2 million right now.
  - Then we will export all the data for the users who were active on above repos and have at least 20 issue/pull related events in all history, also about 2 million right now.
- For all the repos and users, we will export all the metrics implemented in OpenDigger right now with monthly aggregation, users can get quarterly or yearly data by simple calculation.
- Further metrics implemented will be added to export data after the metrics implementation.
- All the metrics will be stored separately into different files, like `activity.json`, `openrank.json`, `issue_resolution_duration.json`, `bus_factor.json` and etc. So developers can easily choose what data they can use."

We can see there has a comment event.  but in our db, we use this query:

`issue_created_at` equals to `issue_updated_at`
This may be wrong because when we check other issue comment events, they all update `issue_updated_at ` field.

So when we upload data to OSS, we can do a little trick to fix the problem. I think we can use like `0.15 * Value_20218 + 0.35 * Value_20219 + 0.35 * Value_202211 + 0.15 * Value_202212` to estimate the actually value of 2021.10, and still we should keep a field `202110_original` to store the real value."

1064,[Refactor] Optimize the `LIMIT` option in metrics interface.,"We need to discuss the `LIMIT` option implementation in metrics.

Like we discussed in [here](#discussion_r1026084184), for `LIMIT` option in metrics query, we have two different implementation logics.

- The first one is `inside limit` which means limit the result count for each time period.
- The second one is `outside limit` which means limit the result in the final step and need to calculate all the result first.

For example, like we need query a metric for companies during 2017 to 2019 and group by year and limit is 5, the first approach means get top 5 companies for each year and combine the result in final step. And the second approach means calculate the metric for all companies in all time period and sort the result by the latest value and then limit the count.

For common situation, the second approach is better and really make sense.

But for ranking list like OpenLeaderboard, we need the first approach since we really need the top 5 results for every time period.

Do I make this clear?

And I think we can add a new option `limitOption` and default is `outside`, and can be `inside`, for data export procedure like OpenLeaderboard, we can set it to `inside`."

"
1071,[Refactor] Add a `orderOption` option for metric query.,"Like discussed in #1067 , we may also need an `orderOption` for metric query.

In the implementations for now, we order the result with the last element of the returned array, but in some scenarios we may want to return the result order by the total number of the results. Like we may need to return the `activity` of companies in last 5 years but order the result not by the recent year but for all 5 years.

So we need a new option called `orderOption` which could be `total` or `latest`, and use `latest` as default value."
1072,[Docs] Add citation file for OpenDigger,"The function [citation]() is provided by GitHub to help researchers to cite GitHub repositories in their paper work.

As we have lots of data for research, we can add a citation file to OpenDigger so researchers can cite the project easily."
1074,[Proposal] discussion of the organized format of the JSON data offered by OpenDigger,"Hi @frank-zsy  , we just talk about the format of the JSON data in [DataEase Metting](). We suggest a new data format but not sure whether it is feasible, so could you help us?
For example, [](), currently, it's data format like below :

we suggest a new data format: 

@tyn1998, If the data format changed, will it have a big impact on the refactoring of hypercrx? @will-ww @xueqidove @xgdyp could you have other suggestions?"

3. Q&A "
1081,[Feature] network data for Hypercrx might be regenerated with latest formulas,"[Hypercrx]() presents network charts in both `Perceptor`s of repo pages and of profile pages. At the moment, there are 4 APIs backing these charts:

- repo
  - related repos: 
  - developer network in this repo: 
- developer
  - related developers: 
  - repo network: 

These data reflect status of repos and developers in the past **180 days** and they are regenerated each week (I suppose?). However, the formulas underpinning the data generation are really outdated, which makes `Activity` of nodes not consistent with the latest `Activity` we use in other charts.

Also, the data mentioned above are deployed in another oss sever, which in my view is not necessary. So I suggest that these data can be implemented here in OpenDigger with the latest computing methods.

We can talk about the schema of the json files here as well."

1087,[Refactor] Upgrade Clickhouse server to 22.8,"As discussed in  , we will upgrade our Clickhouse cloud service server version from 20.8 to 22.8 recently. The data upload progress will be completed in 2 days.

Then we need to upgrade OpenDigger kernel to make sure OpenDigger is compatible with the server version.

The js kernel need to change underlying Clickhouse client library from [`@apla/clickhouse`](@apla/clickhouse) to [`@clickhouse/client`](@clickhouse/client) which is the official js client for Clickhouse and support 22.8 as the minimal version.

For client upgrade, we also need to upgrade Clickhouse sample data server image to 22.8 to make sure it is compatible with OpenDigger.

So the things we need to do includes:

- [x] Upgrade js kernel underlying library. #1098 
- [x] Upgrade python kernel underlying library. #1113 
- [x] Upgrade Clickhouse sample data server image version. #1099 

When all above tasks finished, we can entirely transform from Clickhouse 20.8 to 22.8 with more great features created by Clickhouse in past 2 years."

1089,[proposal] GitHub Bot data requirement,"There are many auto activities in GitHub, such as the apps in [](), and some of them are easy to identify and can accord to the column `user_type,` which divided actors into `User` and `Bot.` However, some Bots also have a `User` type, meaning we have to identify them manually. And these actors are not real human beings and have a high probability produced activities by auto. So I propose the collection of data requires actors' labels about is a Bot or not.

Some of the examples:
- VSCodeTriageBot
- SnoozeThis
- LombiqBot
- renovate-bot
- codestar-github-bot-1
- rjpagano
- zhangsansana"

1105,[Feature] Publish more metrics into OSS.,"As we implement more and more data in OpenDigger, we can publish new metrics data into OSS every month.

We already have about a dozen repo metrics right now on OSS, most of which are statistical metrics or indices that can be accumulate by time. So we only generate monthly data for all metrics, but not quarterly or yearly.

But for other time related metrics like issue resolution duration or issue response time, we can not easily add monthly data to get quarterly or yearly data, we need to generate data for different time range separately.

So I think for new metrics data, we can add quarterly and yearly data too.

We can use `2022-04` to indicate monthly data, `2022` to indicate yearly data and `2022-Q1` to indicate quarterly data, and maybe use `all` to generate data for repos' all life cycle.

This may also effect Hypercrx code right? @tyn1998"
1107,[Question] Why does OpenDigger not provide corresponding metrics for some projects in OpenLeaderboard,"Hi @frank-zsy, when I set filter items to `project`, `openrank`,`china`,`month = 2017/02` in [Open LeaderBoard](), I find the project ranked 298th is [openresty/openresty-systemtap-toolkit](), but I cant find all repo metrics provided by OpenDigger for it.

eg: when I visit , it will show nothing.

is it normal?
"
1109,[Bug] Data update to OSS does not work for vscode and some other repos.,"As we discussed in #1036 , there are some data can not be updated on OSS like `microsoft/vscode` or other repos.


The reason that some repos' data can not be updated contains several key points:

- The upload process is running under MacOS which is a case insensitive system.
- `microsoft` org name used be `Microsoft` and changed to `microsoft` someday, so in the events log, there are two names for the repos under the org.
- As there are about 12 millions files need to be updated and uploaded every month, it is not easy to remove all the files in local machine and regenerate all the files again(`ls` and `rm` will cause crash of bash since too many files under the folder).
- So for effectiveness, I do not remove local files and just generate new data every month and then upload to OSS.
- And for effectiveness too, I do not remove OSS remote files and just update them by uploading.
- So when I generate network data for microsoft org, somehow I created a folder named `Microsoft` in local disk and even though metrics data are generated to path named `microsoft`, the data goes into `Microsoft` since the system is case insensitive, which makes data under `microsoft` on OSS will not be updated.
- The [jina-ai/docarray/issues_closed.json]() issue is also caused by rename, the repo is named as `docarray/docarray` now and `jina-ai/docarray` is an old name of the repo, so the data will not updated since the name has already changed.

So to avoid such thing, following steps should be established:
- To generate data for all metrics, indices and networks, we should always use the latest name of repos and users, and avoid to use old name for any repo or user.
- To generate data locally, we should remove the local files and regenerate again to handle changes of letter case.
- To upload data, we also need to remove remote files and upload again to remove old names files which maybe left behind after change of names."

1115,[Bug] Duplicate repo name in export table,"In monthly export cron task, we use `repo_id` as group key to generate data for export table, but since some repos may be deleted and re-created, then a same repo name may related to more than one repo id.

As export data is indexed by repo name, we should make sure the data for a repo name is related to the latest repo but not old ones. There is an example to this, like `alibaba/hooks`, it was created in 2020.6 once and deleted and re-created about half a month later. So there are two repo ids related to the same repo name, even the new repo id is smaller than the old repo id. Just like the image shows

![image]()

So right now, the exported data for `alibaba/hooks` is related to the old one and not quite correct.

What we should change:

Change the export table init SQL and use `repo_name` as group key and find the latest repo id for all exported names, then the exported data should definitely related to the new repos.

1126,[CI] We should add simple tests to OpenDigger,"Right now, OpenDigger does not have any test code to make sure all the functions are working as expected, like labels, metrics and indices.

But recently, with more and more functions added into OpenDigger, and some refactors also break the code. This implies that human review is not sufficient anymore for OpenDigger.

So I think we should add some simple tests to OpenDigger to make sure:

- All label data works fine and returns desirable results.
- All metrics can run successfully and return correct format data.
- All database drivers works fine.

I think a simple test structure with [mocha]() is enough for now."

1142,[Feature] We need a standard for time range related metrics.,"For now, we start to implement more and more metrics about time range like issue resolution duration, response time and etc.

But we don't have a standard for what data to return for these metrics, like for now, issue resolution duration will return `average` of `median` by config, while response time will return return an array by `thresholds` config.

In practice, after calculating the basic time range for every units, we can get `average`, `median`, `threshold` details at same time with different aggregate functions. And for more, we may also need more quantiles rather than `median` like from 1-9 quantiles as well.

So maybe for all the time range related metrics, we can require the metrics to return `average`, 1-9 `quantiles` and `thresholds` array at same time, so downstream users can use the data as their will."

1160,[Feature] Export new implemented metrics in monthly export task.,"### Description

As I described in #1105 , I would like to export more data to OSS, and before Hypercrx is ready for new keys, I will only export monthly data points.

Export metrics includes:

- Issues active
- Issue resolution duration
- Change request resolution duration
- Issue response time
- Change request response time
- Issue age
- Change request age
- New contributor
- Inactive contributors
- Active dates and times
- Contributor email suffixes

After Hypercrx ready for new keys like `2022`, `2022-Q1`, we will export more data points in the future."

- Time duration related metrics like issue/change request resolution/response time.
- Contributor related metrics like total/active/inactive contributors.
- Issue/change request count related metrics like open/close."

1168,[Feature] downstream apps want to know which repos/users have metric files generated for them,"### Description

Hi, OpenDigger community!

Currently OpenDigger only generates metric data for those active or filtered out, so a lot of repos and users do not have metric files generated for them. As downstream apps, we want to know which ones are data-enabled so many unnecessary data requests can be saved.

For example, whatever the repo or user profile is, Hypercrx now will try to request all metrics for the repo/user. If we are in a public but not active repo like , many 404 errors will be output to the console:

<img width=""1505"" alt=""image"" src="""">

And those errors cannot be catched(actually can be catched but will still be logged into the console) in code so the appearance of them are [inevitable]()!

If there can be a way to check if a repo/user is data-enabled, it must be beneficial."
1172,[Bug] Issues new or closed metric has a minor bug,"### Current Behavior

We use `COUNT()` to count the issues new and issues closed in a time period.

But an issue can be reopened and closed again, so if we use `COUNT()`, the total value of `closed - opened` will be negative if there are `closed` event for reopen issue.

### Expected Behavior

We should change issues new metric implementation or issues closed metric implementation.

For issues new metric, maybe we should also count in the `reopened` action, or for issues closed metric, we can use `COUNT(DISTINCT issue_number)` to eliminate re-closed issue.

But due to our metric is generated by month, `COUNT(DISTINCT issue_number)` for closed issue will still count same issue multiple times if the issue was closed multiple times in different month.

1178,[Doc] Add exported metrics into README ,"### Description

As we implemented and exported lots of new metrics in #1160 and #1162 , we need to add the description to README, and also we can add demos of how to consume the data by ECharts in CodePen like the demo pens in #1163 ."
1180,[Feature] Enrich the metrics documentation,"### Description

Currently, we provide data interfaces for metrics and have an at-a-glance table to show the demos and the implementation code. I think it would be better to provide the relevant links where we discuss and explain the details of the metrics, serving as documentation.

For example, we should provide the relevant issue links for CHAOSS metrics, and blog/article links for activity and OpenRank."
1183,[Doc] Add more website docs for implemented metrics,"### Description

As xiaoya opened the issue #1180 , and I add an example [page](#/metrics/openrank) in OpenDigger website for OpenRank index.

We can add more docs about the metrics and indices we implemented in OpenDigger. The page content should contain:

- The badges about the type( Metric, Index or Network), from (X-lab, CHAOSS), for ( Repo, Developer)
- The definition section for description
- The code section to provide links
- [Optional]The parameters section to show how the parameters are set for the exported data
- CodePen demo section to provide a playground to show how to consume the data

All the CodePen demos are in the README file. We can embed them in the page directly with editable mode enabled."
1186,[Feature] `activity` of each user in a repo by month,"### Description

Hi OpenDigger community,

In Hypercrx we have a feature called `repo's developer network`, which consumes data file like:  With the data in the file, we can know each user's `activity` in that repo with the time span of 90 days.

**Hypercrx is looking forward to datas that has every user's `activity` in every month for a repo.** Maybe the data file is organized in this way:

- 

and a possible json scheme for a file might look like this:



With these data files, Hypercrx can implement features like:

- 
- 
- 

These data can be generated when `repo's activity` is computed, right? Not cost too much?

1216,Add head_ref and base_ref for pull request events in gh_events scheme,"### Description

ClickHouse dataset provides `head_ref` and `base_ref` columns: #download-the-dataset

I found one use case that we can use these columns to separate PRs target to different branches. Thus, I suggest to add these two column in the gh_events scheme.

1245,"[Batch Label Data] Add more label data for Database technical area labled on dbdb.io and DB-Engines Ranking by Mar 31st, 2023.","### Description

I want to add some labeled data into OpenDigger to help us for our community analysis.
The data is based on a dataset fused by data from [dbdb.io]() and [DB-Engines]() by Mar 31st, 2023. It is an optimised version of labeled data submited in , which is only based on DB-Engines Open Soure DBMS in Jan, 2023.

Advantages:
- **More Authoritative**: As of Mar 31st, 2023, [dbdb.io](), which is maintained by [Carnegie Mellon Database Group](), collected 895 DBMS records. It is no less authoritative than [DB-Engines](), which is maintained by [solid IT](), collected 410 DBMS records. And they're all covered here.
- **More Comprehensive**: The dataset integrates information from universities perspective and the industry perspective.
- **More Extensive**: This version contains 532 opensource DBMS records fused by the DBMS records filtered by 'open_source_license' and has 'github_repo_link ' from dbdb.io and DB-Engines, which is far more extensive than the previous version(contains 223 opensource DBMS records) submited in #1136 .
- **More Time-sensitive**: Data collected on Mar 31st, 2023 is more timely than Jan, 2023.
- **More Automated**: This version use git submodule to control the data version and processing flow, and use ascending order on field ""github_repo_link"", which is convenient for subsequent incremental updates. See [dbfeatfusion_records_202303_automerged_manulabeled.csv]().

Filter conditions: Collected by dbdb.io on Mar 31st, 2023 OR Rankings in the DB-Engines Rankings table on Mar 31st, 2023; Has open source license; Has repository link on GitHub.

Notes: The DBMS labeled dataset will keep updating at [birdflyi/db_feature_data_fusion](). The list below is auto-generated by [wiget_autogen_issue_body_for_opendigger_submiting_labeled_data_issue]().

1255,[Sample  Data]   Is it meaningful to use sample data to practice building DataWarehouse?,"### Description

Hi, opendigger's friends ! I encountered a problem and need some suggestions.

I wanner to practice building a `DataWarehouse` with `sample data - Github's global log in 2020`. But when I was doing research, I feel  it's difficult to build using the `DataWarehouse construction process` with the provided data.

So I would like to ask, is the log data provided by opendigger already processed by the `DataWarehouse`, or is it the original data? 

If it is the original data, it may be that I have not been able to sort out the business logic of github; 
if it is the former, it is not meaningful to use this data?

Thanks！😆"

1265,[OSPP2023] Refactor OpenDigger by sql query builder,"### Description

Description：Complex and long SQL is difficult to maintain, this is not conducive to the development of the project. One of the ways to solve this problem is to create SQL through SQL builder, which can help us reduce the difficulty of reading SQL, especially subquery. So we want to explore whether there is a mature framework that can help OpenDigger.
In Python, we can use pypika which is a python pkg supporting some of clickhouse sql syntax. So what we need to do is to investigate in detail whether it can cover our sql, and whether it will really improve OpenDigger.

If yes, we can refactor Python kernel first as OSPP task. I think I can follow up on this project.

Expected outcomes:
metrics generated by python sql builder

Skills:
python typescript javascript SQL

1266,[OSPP2023] Data Quality Assurance & Metrics Explanation by case,"### Description

During the development of indicators, we need to verify whether the written sql gets the correct query results.Our previous approach was to select a repo and compare the data manually. At the same time, sometimes the data is missing, and we are often not sure whether our implements are wrong or the data is abnormal. This approach is inefficient and error-prone.

So we need some DQA mechanism to finish data-check and metric check automatically.

Further more, I think we can add a dataset and using this for metrics explanation.
e.g. the result of one metric runs on this dataset is 10.
and we can clearly understand which records make this metric 10, and display these records

The commit_comment_id 107503652 relates to #commitcomment-107503652 .
There are 2 comments on commit 8218c47. However, without commit sha 8218c47 or 8218c473d3eb9fdbc0ec2b16eddb49eaab2590ae，it is really hard to **Retrieve** the parent node or  **Concatenate Web Page Address** with commit_comment_id 107503652.
I'd like to know if there is a way to get commit sha like 8218c473d3eb9fdbc0ec2b16eddb49eaab2590ae for each commit comment?

**Annotations**
---
**Case SQL**: SELECT * FROM opensource.gh_events WHERE created_at between '2023-04-01 00:00:00' and '2023-04-10 00:00:00' and repo_name='elastic/elasticsearch' and type='CommitCommentEvent' limit 2;

**Retrieve**: 
Parent node id as P, This node id as T, Child node id as C
- 'PullRequestEvent' related columns: issue_id (P), pull_merge_commit_sha (T), ...
- 'PullRequestReviewEvent': pull_merge_commit_sha (P), pull_review_id (T), ...
- 'PullRequestReviewCommentEvent': pull_review_id (P), pull_review_comment_id (T), ...

The relations between 'PullRequestEvent', 'PullRequestReviewEvent' are linked by pull_merge_commit_sha, and the relations between 'PullRequestReviewEvent', 'PullRequestReviewCommentEvent' are linked by pull_review_id. Hence there exists an event dependency based retrieval path among them.

**Concatenate Web Page Address**: 
schema pattern + arguments value dict
e.g. `#commitcomment-107503652` can be concatenated by 
- schema pattern: `{repo_name}/commit/{commit_sha}#commitcomment-{commit_comment_id}`
- arguments value dict: `{""repo_name"": ""elastic/elasticsearch"", ""commit_sha"":""8218c473d3eb9fdbc0ec2b16eddb49eaab2590ae"", ""commit_comment_id"":""107503652""}`"

Right now, OpenDigger has label data for almost 10k repos, we can export the data for public use too.

We already export the labels to each org and repo, another thing is to export top level label data to certain path so users can use it to get all repos or orgs list for a certain label.

The URL could be {label_id}.json"
1360,the results of metric 'changeRequestsAcceptanceRatio'  is random,"### Description

As mentioned in the issue #1266 ，because there are many repositories that don't decline the PR , their metric 'changeRequestsAcceptanceRatio' is 1. I set 'limit' is 3, and 'order' is 'DESC' , however the result is random. There is no definite result.

Right now, all exported users and repos have a meta.json file to indicate the update timestamp, label info and etc.

Since GitHub API has rate limit for tokens, we can collect users and repos info and put into meta.json file for downstream apps to use. So they do not have to query the GitHub API in frontend. Although the data may not be up-to-date, it still solves lots of problems.

It can be implemented as a cron task."

1387,[NOTICE] For any repo requests refined community OpenRank.,"### Description

OpenDigger right now provides community OpenRank results for several repos like X-lab projects, Sealos and 20 projects under Alibaba contribution leaderboard.

In the future, any repo could request the refined community OpenRank, where refined means reactions data which is not in the GitHub log data will also be collected to correct the result.

The only way to get refined community OpenRank is installing [open-digger-bot]() to the repo. After the installation, backend data service will collect all the issues/pulls' reactions for the repo and store into the graph database for further calculation.

Additionally, repos not installing open-digger-bot will also be included in community OpenRank calculation without reactions correction which means we can get all the community OpenRank results for all the repos on GitHub."

1430,[Discussion] I hope to donate stevending1st/open-digger-cli to the x-lab2017,"### Description

I am very happy to participate in the openSODA competition. Although the competition has ended today, the iteration and update of [the project]() have not. I hope that the project can continue to be maintained. However, my personal ability and time are limited. If the project can be donated to x-lab, together with other members and contributors in the community, it will benefit the development of the project and openDigger.

This project has the following characteristics compared to other projects. First, the technology stack used here is consistent with openDigger for ease of maintenance. Second, this project implements functionality through plugins, which will reduce the core code.

It is expected that the project will take 6-8 months to be refactored if it needs to be improved to a level that can be donated.

1454,[Feature] Refactor the cron task config mechanism ,"### Description

Right now, the cron tasks hold their own task `enable` and `immediate` config in the task file.

But this is not quite easy for user to deploy OpenDigger since they need to modify the source code to enable a cron task.

We can extract the `enable` and `immediate` task config into config file and task runner can use the config file to control the process directly, so users can only modify the config in their own local config file to enable tasks which is much more friendly."

As we included Gitee data into OpenDigger, some multiple repos project are included like openHarmony, openEuler, anolis and etc. So right now if we start to ranking projects in different ranking list, we need to use `project` level data rather than `repo` level data since one community may contains lots of repos.

1484,[Bug] Incorrect data label 'Tech-N' and labels list in labeled_data/technology and labeled_data/application_domain,"### Current Behavior

In [label_data](): 
Some categories, e.g. [infrastructure](), are not included in the label of [labeled_data/technology/ai/generative_ai/index.yml]() file,  which will cause miss counting when calculating the overall database open source data; 
Some leaf node yml files, e.g. [labeled_data/technology/ai/generative_ai/application/audio.yml](), has the same label level with its parent level file [labeled_data/technology/ai/generative_ai/application/index.yml]() file, which will cause mixed counting when calculating the overall database open source data.

### Expected Behavior

Add the untracked categories into its parent node index.yml label list.
Change the 'Tech-N' label to match the default template: increase N from root node to leaf node based on depth.

Right now, global_openrank script is part of OpenDigger to calculate the global OpenRank for all repos and users, we also should include the community_openrank script in OpenDigger which is now in a private repo of mine.

This will simplify the data process in every month and make the code easy to maintain.

1496,feat: How to deal with the repo items without any label inside of index.yml files?,"Agree with the opinion: the index.yml files in labeled_data should only have `labels`.

              Are all the repos below can not be assigned to any above categories? I think they should be set to above categories since there is an `other` sub field.

I think the best way to do this is that `Application` should only have `labels`, all the orgs or repos should be in sub labels.

1497,[Feature] Export community OpenRank metric,"### Description

As implemented in #1493 , we added community OpenRank task in OpenDigger.

Then we need to add an interface to get community OpenRank metric in OpenDigger and export the data too.

> NOTE: we need to transform the community OpenRank to an unified value, so we can compare the contribution across different repositories."
1499,[Feature] Add more columns into community_openrank table,"### Description

Right now, the community_openrank table only contains the repo_id and actor_id, but in order to process the metric procedure which contains some standard repo, org selection, we should also add actor_login, repo_name, org_id and org_login columns into the table too.

With above columns, we can easily add the metric interface in current framework.

1553,能提供公开查询指标数据的接口，这很棒！但是感觉不如 OSS Compass 活跃，有点可惜,"### Description

OSS Compass 与 CHAOSS 和 魔法书 做了联动（CHAOSS 官网上写了 OSS Compass 是合作伙伴），还参与开源之夏等活动，这带来了许多流量；OSS Compass 在其官网上有详细的文档，每个模型和指标都有介绍，还可以自选指标自定义模型，可以清楚了解数据计算过程。但 OSS Compass 最大缺点是其指标数据库不是完全开放查阅的，需要单独联系专人获取（还不一定给），相比之下有些封闭。
希望 OpenDigger 更加完善一下文档和官网，多做一些联动，丰富生态，兼容更多托管平台，做出更强大的开源评价模型与方法。
祝Xlab和OpenDigger越来越好！越来越有影响力！"

Some suggestions for this task are as follows:
1. For example, bus factor provided the explanatory documentation:  You can refer to the above document and write the introduction document.
2. All metrics have been implemented with the capability for visualization display. You can enhance CodePan to include more interpretative visualizations for the existing demos.

1562,[OSS101] Task4:  Mirror Source Management Tool,"### Description

When deploying OpenDigger using Docker, the installation of some dependencies relies on the usage of the Tsinghua mirror source.  Refer to: open-digger/Dockerfile

Currently, specific versions are specified for installation. However, if the Tsinghua mirror source updates or discontinues services for older versions, installation will fail. 

This task requires implementing an automated tool to identify whether the existing mirror source can successfully install and to promptly replace the mirror source to resolve conflicts between installation packages.

The relevant code and dataset for this task need to be provided in the repository."
1563,[OSS101] Task5: Automatic label classification task based on machine/deep learning methods.,"### Description

Existing repository label data relies heavily on manual labeling. 
You can attempt to design or utilize machine learning/deep learning methods to automatically identify and annotate data for any subclass of label data. (Refer to open-digger/labeled_data)

 Simultaneously, the labeled data can be used to fit and validate the designed or utilized methods.

The relevant code and document for this task need to be provided in the repository."

The task objective is to create an open source domain visualization dashboard based on the **data provided by OpenDigger** or **obtained independently**. This dashboard will primarily be used to display real-time status, trends, and relationships of large-scale data, enabling users to quickly and accurately understand the overall situation of the data.

In terms of visualization libraries, popular open-source options include D3.js, Echarts, Highcharts, AntV, etc. For frontend frameworks, React, Vue, Angular, and others are highly favored.
Additionally, there are numerous data visualization and analysis tools available. Open source tools like DataEase, Superset, Metabase, as well as commercial tools like Power BI, FineBI, Tableau, etc., can assist users in analyzing data rapidly and gaining insights into business trends.

Hey there! So, I just checked out OpenDigger’s cool new ranking of open-source foundations worldwide, and I gotta say, some of the findings are quite surprising! Like, who would’ve thought OpenAtom is ahead of CNCF in terms of influence? I’m thinking this might have something to do with missing data.

2. 如果我想对OpenRank做一些自定义修改——改一下涉及到边权的指标和权重，只是自己使用。在[openrank-neo4j-gds]()是否能做到这一点呢？看概述有点看不出来。
