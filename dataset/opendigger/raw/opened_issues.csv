As xiaoya opened the issue #1180 , and I add an example [page](http://www.x-lab.info/open-digger/#/metrics/openrank) in OpenDigger website for OpenRank index.

We can add more docs about the metrics and indices we implemented in OpenDigger. The page content should contain:

- The badges about the type( Metric, Index or Network), from (X-lab, CHAOSS), for ( Repo, Developer)
- The definition section for description
- The code section to provide links
- [Optional]The parameters section to show how the parameters are set for the exported data
- CodePen demo section to provide a playground to show how to consume the data

All the CodePen demos are in the README file. We can embed them in the page directly with editable mode enabled."

tyn1998,1306,[Data Export] shorten the oss uploading time in the beginning of every month ,"### Description

Hi community,

Is it possible to shorten the oss uploading time in the beggining of every month? Or could you choose a fixed day from a month and anounce it as a due date before which all data exporting tasks are completed?

This is so important for downstream apps who consume OpenDigger's valuable data.

frank-zsy,1387,[NOTICE] For any repo requests refined community OpenRank.,"### Description

OpenDigger right now provides community OpenRank results for several repos like X-lab projects, Sealos and 20 projects under Alibaba contribution leaderboard.

In the future, any repo could request the refined community OpenRank, where refined means reactions data which is not in the GitHub log data will also be collected to correct the result.

The only way to get refined community OpenRank is installing [open-digger-bot](https://github.com/apps/open-digger-bot) to the repo. After the installation, backend data service will collect all the issues/pulls' reactions for the repo and store into the graph database for further calculation.

Additionally, repos not installing open-digger-bot will also be included in community OpenRank calculation without reactions correction which means we can get all the community OpenRank results for all the repos on GitHub."
stevending1st,1431,[Feature] OpenRank algorithm SDK,"### Description

We now like the openRank algorithm very much and hope to use the openRank algorithm to implement an integration system: [KToken](https://github.com/kaiyuanshe/KToken). 

I don't know whether openRank provides relevant SDK now, so it is convenient to calculate the relevant score."
frank-zsy,1465,[Feature] We need to extract more `Project` type labels.,"### Description

As we included Gitee data into OpenDigger, some multiple repos project are included like openHarmony, openEuler, anolis and etc. So right now if we start to ranking projects in different ranking list, we need to use `project` level data rather than `repo` level data since one community may contains lots of repos.

So we can extract commonly seen open source communities into project level label so we can use project to group the result."
birdflyi,1496,feat: How to deal with the repo items without any label inside of index.yml files?,"Agree with the opinion: the index.yml files in labeled_data should only have `labels`.

              Are all the repos below can not be assigned to any above categories? I think they should be set to above categories since there is an `other` sub field.

I think the best way to do this is that `Application` should only have `labels`, all the orgs or repos should be in sub labels.

Peng99999,1559,[OSS101] Task1: Add the label data about AIGC,"### Description

AIGC (AI-Generated Content) refers to a new method of content production that utilizes AI technology (generative AI approaches) to create content. 

There is now a label classification system for generative large language models (LLMs), and there is already some label data available. Specific classification systems and data can be found in #1418. 

Recently, many latest generative large language models have emerged. It is now necessary to update and add the label data.

Plase add these data in this repository/labeled_data/technology/ai/genertaive_ai:

Please provide complete documentation and code."

Some suggestions for this task are as follows:
1. For example, bus factor provided the explanatory documentation: https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-bus-factor/. You can refer to the above document and write the introduction document.
2. All metrics have been implemented with the capability for visualization display. You can enhance CodePan to include more interpretative visualizations for the existing demos.

The relevant code, documents and **references** for this task need to be provided in the repository."
Peng99999,1562,[OSS101] Task4:  Mirror Source Management Tool,"### Description

When deploying OpenDigger using Docker, the installation of some dependencies relies on the usage of the Tsinghua mirror source.  Refer to: open-digger/Dockerfile

Currently, specific versions are specified for installation. However, if the Tsinghua mirror source updates or discontinues services for older versions, installation will fail. 

This task requires implementing an automated tool to identify whether the existing mirror source can successfully install and to promptly replace the mirror source to resolve conflicts between installation packages.

The relevant code and dataset for this task need to be provided in the repository."
Peng99999,1563,[OSS101] Task5: Automatic label classification task based on machine/deep learning methods.,"### Description

Existing repository label data relies heavily on manual labeling. 
You can attempt to design or utilize machine learning/deep learning methods to automatically identify and annotate data for any subclass of label data. (Refer to open-digger/labeled_data)

 Simultaneously, the labeled data can be used to fit and validate the designed or utilized methods.

The relevant code and document for this task need to be provided in the repository."

Peng99999,1565,[OSS101] Task7: Open source domain visualization dashboard,"### Description

The task objective is to create an open source domain visualization dashboard based on the **data provided by OpenDigger** or **obtained independently**. This dashboard will primarily be used to display real-time status, trends, and relationships of large-scale data, enabling users to quickly and accurately understand the overall situation of the data.

In terms of visualization libraries, popular open-source options include D3.js, Echarts, Highcharts, AntV, etc. For frontend frameworks, React, Vue, Angular, and others are highly favored.
Additionally, there are numerous data visualization and analysis tools available. Open source tools like DataEase, Superset, Metabase, as well as commercial tools like Power BI, FineBI, Tableau, etc., can assist users in analyzing data rapidly and gaining insights into business trends.
